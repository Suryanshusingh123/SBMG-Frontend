## 🔧 Configuration

### API Configuration
Update the API base URL in `src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api';
```

### Role Configuration
Customize role features in `src/utils/roleConfig.js`:
- Dashboard titles
- Available features
- Menu items
- Color schemes

## 📊 Data Integration

Currently, the application uses mock data for demonstration. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Update the API endpoints in `src/services/api.js`
2. Modify the `useEffect` hooks in dashboard components to fetch real data
3. Update the authentication logic in `src/pages/Login.jsx`

Example API integration:
```javascript
import { dashboardAPI } from '../services/api';

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await dashboardAPI.getCEOData();
      setRevenueData(response.data.revenue);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

## 🚀 Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## 🧪 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
Each role has a unique color scheme defined in `roleConfig.js`:
- CEO: Blue (#1e40af)
- BDO: Green (#15803d)
- VDO: Purple (#9333ea)

### Charts
Charts can be customized in individual dashboard components. Recharts provides extensive customization options.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The dashboard is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: 2-column grid
- Desktop: 4-column grid for metrics

## 🔐 Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The current implementation uses demo authentication. For production:

1. Implement proper backend authentication
2. Use secure token storage (httpOnly cookies recommended)
3. Add CSRF protection
4. Implement proper session management
5. Add input validation and sanitization
